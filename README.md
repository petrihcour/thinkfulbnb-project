# Thinkfulbnb

Hey there, I'm Vanessa! Welcome to Thinkfulbnb, a static vacation rental website designed to practice HTML, CSS (including flexbox), and forms. It's not an interactive site but serves as a platform for honing my front-end development skills.

Thinkfulbnb is a vacation rental website that allows people to rent out their homes to people who are seeking short-term accommodations in that locale. Thinkfulbnb hosts rent out different kinds of properties, including single rooms, apartments, and unique living spaces such as yachts, houseboats, yurts, tiny houses, and even renovated medieval castles.

## Project Highlights
- **Purpose**: Thinkfulbnb is a project intended for practice and learning. It provides an opportunity to apply HTML and CSS concepts, including flexbox, and create a responsive design for different devices.
- **User Experience**: I worked with user interface mockups to create a responsive design that provides a great experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Tech Stack**: As a front-end engineer, I used a stack that includes HTML, CSS, and various frameworks to bring Thinkfulbnb to life.
- **Navigation**: The project features a single-page navigation system, making it easy for users to find what they need quickly.
- **Responsive Design**: I used flexbox to achieve responsive layouts and adapted the design for both mobile and desktop views.

## Getting Started

To set up the project, you can use VSCode Live Server to launch the index.html page in your browser. Feel free to explore the existing files and make any necessary edits to meet the project requirements.

## Tasks

For those interested in using this project for practice, here are the tasks to complete:

- **Follow a mobile-first development approach.**
- **Navigation**: Modify the navigation links to create a single-page navigation system that takes the user to the corresponding sections on the page.
- **HTML Form**: Create a form in the "Find your perfect vacation rental" section with specific input fields and styles.
- **Vertical Content Alignment**: Adjust the content in various sections for mobile and desktop views.
- **Responsive Images**: Write CSS for all images to ensure they match the container width.
- **Media Query**: Create a media query for screens wider than 768px to adapt the design for the desktop view.
  
## Future Goals
As this project evolves, my future goals include further enhancing my front-end development skills, adding more features, and refining the design. I'm excited about the possibilities!
