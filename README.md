Welcome to Thinkfulbnb, a static vacation rental website designed to practice HTML, CSS (including flexbox), and forms. It's not an interactive site but serves as a platform for practicing my front-end development skills. Check out the [demo](https://petrihcour.github.io/thinkfulbnb-project/)!

## Project Context

Thinkfulbnb is a vacation rental website that allows people to rent out their homes to those seeking short-term accommodations in various locales. Thinkfulbnb hosts offer a range of properties, including single rooms, apartments, and unique living spaces such as yachts, houseboats, yurts, tiny houses, and even renovated medieval castles. The primary purpose of this project is educational, allowing me to apply HTML and CSS concepts and create a responsive design for different devices.
